## Challenge Summary: Challenge 1 - Reverse an Array
* Using C# and VS, write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge Description
* This challenge relies on translating for loops and arrays effectively in C#, based on prior knowledge in .js.

## Approach & Efficiency
Using for loops, return an array, then return another array in reverse. 

## Solution
This one I didn't have a whiteboard image. 



## Challenge Summary: Challenge 2 - Shift an Array + Add a Number 

* Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description: 

* This challenge relies on taking in a number, finding the middle of an array, and returning a new array with the additional number included. 

## Approach & Efficiency
* I used knowledge I had previously about how to add a spot for a new number, find the middle of an array, and return a new array with the additional int inserted.

## Challenge Summary: Challenge 5 - Linked Lists
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge Description
* This challenges provides practice for linked libraries

## Approach & Efficiency
Using methods insert, include, and to string. 

## Solution
This one I didn't have a whiteboard image.
